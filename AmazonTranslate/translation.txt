In Szczebrzessin, the beetle sounds in a reed
And Szczebrzeszyn is famous for it.

An ox asks him: “Lord of the beetle,
Why are you so buzzing in the thicket?”

“Like this - for what? This is job,
Every job pays off”.

“And what do you get for that?”

“Also a question! All grosss,
All reeds after all time,
Meadlands, fields and woods,
Even the rivers, even the trees,
All this is mine!”

The ox thought, “Excellent,
I'll start such a life, too.”
Back home and cheerfully
He started buzzing under the barn
After the will, the bass.
And here Maciek walked.

As he doesn't squeeze: “What does that mean?
Why is it a vacuum ox?”
“How's this? Don't I do anything?
I'm just buzzing.”

“I'll buzz you here, I will,
Entuse of it! Driving into the field!”

And he gave him such a job,
That the ox was doused afterwards.

After the job, he ran into thickets.
“Already I will avenge it on the beetle!”

But there was no beetle in the reed,
Because the beetle was just buzzing in Pszczyno.
